## Usage

### Pre-requisites

This action only processes already existing fixes files so they have to be generated by a previous step in your workflow. This can be done, e.g. by clang-tidy-diff when using the `-export-fixes` parameter.

### Inputs

* `fixesFile`: Path to the file which was generated by clang-tidy

### Example

```yaml
- name: Process clang-tidy warnings
  uses: asarium/clang-tidy-action@v1
  with:
    fixesFile: clang-fixes.yaml
```
